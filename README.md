# ARC9 BOCW Assault Rifles

5 BOCW Assault Rifles on the base [ARC9](https://github.com/HaodongMo/ARC-9)

It has been 4 months since I was able to post something. These AR's really put me up to the test and took a lot of time to finish. Coupled with stuff I have to deal with in the real world, this one took way longer than anticipated. Really hope this is a good delivery of some cold war weapons content. Have fun!
